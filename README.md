## Hi there! 👋

I'm **Aether**, a Software Engineering student and Design Engineer with a passion for creating intuitive and beautiful user interfaces. I recently completed an internship with Apple's Maps Design Engineering team as part of the Class of 2024.

### 🚀 Current Projects

- **Kyo**: My first major app—a school planner and organizer built with SwiftUI. Kyo helps students manage their academic life more efficiently.
- **Amethyst**: A collection of UI components for SwiftUI on iOS and iPadOS built for Kyo 1.0

### 🤝 Open to Collaborate

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that need UI expertise, whether it's designing interfaces or turning designs into production-ready code. If you're working on something exciting, let's connect!
