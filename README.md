## Hi there! 👋

I'm **Aether**, a Software Engineering student and Design Engineer with a passion for creating intuitive and visually stunning user experiences. I previously completed an internship with Apple's Maps Design Engineering team, where I worked on bridging design and engineering as part of the Class of 2024.

### 🚀 Current Projects

- **Kyo**: My first major app—a school planner and organizer built with SwiftUI. Kyo empowers students to manage their academic life with ease and style.  
  - Currently working on **Kyo 2.0**, featuring exciting new functionalities and design enhancements.  

- **Amethyst**: A collection of UI components for SwiftUI on iOS and iPadOS, forming the foundation for Kyo 1.0 and beyond.  

- **FlavorKit**: A new system for colors in SwiftUI projects, featuring preset themes and user-created themes. Both support primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, and quinary colors, all compatible with light and dark mode.

- **Garnish**: A Swift package for dynamic color adjustments and contrast management, ensuring accessible and visually harmonious interfaces in light and dark themes. Available now as an [open-source project](https://github.com/Aeastr/Garnish).

- **CursorBounds**: A Swift package that provides precise information about the position and bounds of the text cursor (caret) in macOS applications.  
  It leverages the macOS Accessibility API to retrieve the caret's location and bounding rectangle, with robust fallback mechanisms.

### 🤝 Open to Collaborate

I'm looking to collaborate on projects that need UI/SwiftUI expertise, whether it's designing interfaces or turning designs into production-ready code. If you're working on something exciting, let's connect!
