## 👋 yo, i'm aether. i build things. sometimes i share them.  

i’m a design engineer. which basically means i don’t just make things look good—I make them **work**. sometimes, while doing that, i end up building little tools, libraries, or components that solve annoying problems. if they seem useful, i throw them out into the world.  

i don’t call myself a dev, but if i’m writing code and shipping it, does it even matter?  

i used to intern at apple (maps design engineering), where i learned how to push pixels and code in ways that actually make a difference. now i’m finishing my degree, open-sourcing some things, and working on projects that keep me sane.

### 📦 open source things i've thrown into the void:  
- **[NotchMyProblem](#)** – wanted buttons that perfectly hug the iphone notch. positioning buttons around the iphone notch shouldn’t be that hard. so i made this.  
- **[CursorBounds](#)** – needed precise text cursor positions on macos. accessibility api helped, but it’s weird. now it’s a package.
- **[Garnish](#)** – ui colors should just *work*. this helps.
- **[GlowGetter](#)** – colors being brighter than the rest of the screen seemed cool for some UI ideas, this lets you do that, or whatever idea you have
- **[SwiftUI AdaptiveImageGlyph](#)** – example for rich text editing in swiftui, bc genmojis exist now. (more of an example, proper package later)

### 🚀 other things i’ve built
- **Kyo** – a school planner & organizer built with swiftui. students deserve good ui too. currently working on kyo 2.0, which is getting a full redesign & more depth.
- **Amethyst & Avalanche** – collections of swiftui components. one was for kyo 1.0, the other is me experimenting with depth again. wip.
- **FlavorKit** – a theming system for swiftui that actually makes sense. presets + user-created themes that just work.

more coming soon, probably.  

### 🛠 what i actually do:  
- build **apps, interfaces, and tools** that make interacting with tech feel effortless  
- obsess over **systems, not just visuals**  
- occasionally regret every decision that led to a complicated problem but solve it anyway
- sometimes occasionally build something so specific that only 3 people in the world will ever need it

### 🤝 open to cool things
if you’re building something interesting in swiftui, ui/ux, or spatial computing, i’m down to chat. otherwise, i’ll be here, making things work.
