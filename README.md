# üëã yo, i'm aether

i build things. sometimes i share them.

i'm a design engineer‚Äîwhich basically means i don't just make things look good, i make them **work**. sometimes while doing that, i end up building little tools that solve annoying problems. if they seem useful, i throw them out into the world.

ex-apple maps intern, swift student challenge '25 winner. finishing my degree, open-sourcing some things, working on projects that keep me sane.

## üöÄ other things i've built
- **kyo** ‚Äì a school planner & organizer built with swiftui. students deserve good ui too. currently tearing it down and rebuilding from scratch for 2.0‚Äînew design, more depth, less chaos.
- **deco** ‚Äì wallpaper studio for crafting unique lock screens with photos, gradients, stripes, and stickers. started as a swift student challenge project, now on the app store. won for '25.

more coming soon, probably.

## üõ† what i actually do
- build **apps, interfaces, and tools** that make interacting with tech feel effortless
- obsess over **systems, not just visuals**
- occasionally regret every decision that led to a complicated problem but solve it anyway
- sometimes build something so specific that only 3 people in the world will ever need it

## ü§ù open to cool things
if you're building something interesting in swiftui, ui/ux, or spatial computing, i'm down to chat. otherwise, i'll be here, making things work.

üëæ built in public, shipped for fun, by aether

_see you in the void._
