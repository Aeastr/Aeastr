# üëã yo, i'm aether

i build things. sometimes i share them.

i'm a design engineer‚Äîwhich basically means i don't just make things look good, i make them **work**. sometimes while doing that, i end up building little tools that solve annoying problems. if they seem useful, i throw them out into the world.

ex-apple maps intern, swift student challenge '25 winner. finishing my degree, open-sourcing some things, working on projects that keep me sane.

| | project | what it does |
|---|---------|--------------|
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="Portal" width="45"> | **[Portal](https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal)** | seamless element transitions across root, sheets, and navigation pushes in SwiftUI. flexible af. portals, basically. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/Garnish/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="Garnish" width="45"> | **[Garnish](https://github.com/Aeastr/Garnish)** | UI colors should just *work*. this helps. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/UniversalGlass/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="Universal Glass" width="45"> | **[UniversalGlass](https://github.com/Aeastr/UniversalGlass)** | desc pending. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/NotchMyProblem/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="NotchMyProblem" width="45"> | **[NotchMyProblem](https://github.com/Aeastr/NotchMyProblem)** | wanted buttons that perfectly hug the iphone cutout. positioning shouldn't be that hard, so i made this. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/RenderMeThis/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="RenderMeThis" width="45"> | **[RenderMeThis](https://github.com/Aeastr/RenderMeThis)** | useful for optimizing view rendering/computation. needed it during deco development, hope others find use. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/MenuWithAView/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="MenuWithAView" width="45"> | **[MenuWithAView](https://github.com/Aeastr/MenuWithAView)** | imessage has a really cool menu accessory, this lets you add your own to any context menu. use with **care**. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/GlowGetter/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="GlowGetter" width="45"> | **[GlowGetter](https://github.com/Aeastr/GlowGetter)** | elements being brighter than the rest of the screen seemed cool for some UI ideas. this lets you do that. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/LogOutLoud/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="LogOutLoud" width="45"> | **[LogOutLoud](https://github.com/Aeastr/LogOutLoud)** | just what i use for logs in my apps. centralized and less boilerplate. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/GlyphMeThat/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="GlyphMeThat" width="45"> | **[GlyphMeThat](https://github.com/Aeastr/GlyphMeThat)** | genmojis are kinda fun, they're backed by NSAdaptiveImageGlyph. wasn't exposed for SwiftUI + couldn't get them as images. this fixes that. |
| <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/CursorBounds/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="CursorBounds" width="45"> | **[CursorBounds](https://github.com/Aeastr/CursorBounds)** | needed precise text cursor positions on macOS. accessibility API helped, but it's weird. now it's a package. |

## üöÄ other things i've built
- **kyo** ‚Äì a school planner & organizer built with swiftui. students deserve good ui too. currently tearing it down and rebuilding from scratch for 2.0‚Äînew design, more depth, less chaos.
- **deco** ‚Äì wallpaper studio for crafting unique lock screens with photos, gradients, stripes, and stickers. started as a swift student challenge project, now on the app store. won for '25.

more coming soon, probably.

## üõ† what i actually do
- build **apps, interfaces, and tools** that make interacting with tech feel effortless
- obsess over **systems, not just visuals**
- occasionally regret every decision that led to a complicated problem but solve it anyway
- sometimes build something so specific that only 3 people in the world will ever need it

## ü§ù open to cool things
if you're building something interesting in swiftui, ui/ux, or spatial computing, i'm down to chat. otherwise, i'll be here, making things work.

üëæ built in public, shipped for fun, by aether

_see you in the void._
