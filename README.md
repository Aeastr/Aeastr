## 👋 yo, i'm aether. i build things. sometimes i share them.  

i’m a design engineer. which basically means i don’t just make things look good—I make them **work**. sometimes, while doing that, i end up building little tools, libraries, or components that solve annoying problems. if they seem useful, i throw them out into the world.  

i don’t call myself a dev, but if i’m writing code and shipping it, does it even matter?  

i used to intern at apple (maps design engineering), where i learned how to push pixels and code in ways that actually make a difference. now i’m finishing my degree, open-sourcing some things, and working on projects that keep me sane.

### 📦 open source things i've thrown into the void:  
- <img src="assets/portal-icon.png" alt="Portal Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:top; margin-right:5px;"> **[Portal](https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal)** – seamless element transitions across root, sheets, and navigation pushes in SwiftUI. flexible af. portals, basically.

- <img src="assets/glowGetter-icon.png" alt="GlowGetter Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[GlowGetter](https://github.com/Aeastr/GlowGetter)** – colors being brighter than the rest of the screen seemed cool for some UI ideas, this lets you do that, or whatever idea you have.
  
- <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/GlyphMeThat/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="GlyphMeThat Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[GlyphMeThat](https://github.com/Aeastr/GlyphMeThat)** – genmojis are kinda fun, they're backed by NSAdaptiveImageGylph, which wsan't exposed for SwiftUI fields + we couldn't just get them as images, this resolves that
  
- <img src="assets/notchMyProblem-icon.png" alt="NotchMyProblem Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[NotchMyProblem](https://github.com/Aeastr/NotchMyProblem)** – wanted buttons that perfectly hug the iphone notch. Positioning buttons around the iphone notch shouldn’t be that hard, so i made this.
  
- <img src="https://github.com/Aeastr/LogOutLoud/blob/main/assets/icon.png" alt="LogOutLoud Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[LogOutLoud](https://github.com/Aeastr/LogOutLoud)** – just what i use for logs in my apps, centralized and less boilerplate
  
- <img src="assets/cursorBounds-icon.png" alt="CursorBounds Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[CursorBounds](https://github.com/Aeastr/CursorBounds)** – needed precise text cursor positions on macOS. Accessibility API helped, but it’s weird. now it’s a package.
  
- <img src="assets/garnish-icon.png" alt="Garnish Icon" width="24" style="vertical-align:middle; margin-right:5px;"> **[Garnish](https://github.com/Aeastr/Garnish)** – UI colors should just *work*. this helps.


### 🚀 other things i’ve built
- **Kyo** – a school planner & organizer built with swiftui. students deserve good ui too. currently working on kyo 2.0, which is getting a full redesign & more depth.
- **Deco** - a wallpaper studio for crafting unique lock screens with photos, gradients, stripes, and stickers. started as a swift student challenge project, now on the app store. won for '25.

more coming soon, probably.  

### 🛠 what i actually do:  
- build **apps, interfaces, and tools** that make interacting with tech feel effortless  
- obsess over **systems, not just visuals**  
- occasionally regret every decision that led to a complicated problem but solve it anyway
- sometimes occasionally build something so specific that only 3 people in the world will ever need it

### 🤝 open to cool things
if you’re building something interesting in swiftui, ui/ux, or spatial computing, i’m down to chat. otherwise, i’ll be here, making things work.
