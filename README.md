### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first major app Kyo, a school planner and organiser. I've previously experimented with SwiftUI for some prototype apps, but Kyo is my first full production project
- ðŸ‘€ I'm also building Amethyst, a collection of UI components for SwiftUI in iOS, iPadOS, macOS and visionOS
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects looking for UI work, whether it's just design or converting design to actual production code

- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about design, SwiftUI and Spatial Computing
